Functions/Variables
######################## docs.python.org
print("hello, world") -- print = console.log
input -- prompt, like in inquirer :::: return value is the prompt input [name = input("What's your name?")]

note: (Comments are left with #)
can leave multilines with """ comments """

template literals :::: f"Hello {variable}" [just add an f before the string and brackets around the variable!]

print('hello,', end=' ') #Can actually edit the end option directly (we only know this via the python docs)
print('World') #now they print on the same line, cool right? since the default for print ends with \n

Interesting that "end" is just passed in as an argument and not as an option object

String Methods
#######################
str = str.strip() removes whitespace from str :::: aka .trim in js
str = str.capitalize() capitalizes the first letter (pretty cool)
str = str.title() captializes the first letter of each word

str = str.split(" ") splits it on whitespace into an array [exactly like js]
can even destructure from an array --- first, last = name.split(" ")    [unlike in js where we do const [first,last] = name.split(" ")]

Int Methods
########################
int("1") = 1 :::: [basically parseInt()]
+, -, / , *, %

Float Methods
#######################
float("1.2") = 1.2 :::: [turns the string into a float if applicable]
round(float("1.2")) = 1 :::: [Way better than Math.floor()]
round(float(".3333"), 2) = .33 :::: rounds to 2 decimals
f"{number:,}" :::: [formats the number with commas]
f"{number:.2f}" :::: formats the number to 2 decimals

Functions
#######################
hello() is a function call
def :::: is the keyword to define Functions [indents are important - indent below that code is part of that function]
def hello(): 
    print("hello")

def hello(name="luke"): [can define default values like in JS. very similar def = function]
    print(f"hello {name}")

functions must be above the call in the python script.

New Convention.####### now we can define our functions in any order so long as main is the last thing called
def main():
    name = input("What's your name? ")
    hello(name)

variables are scoped inside of the function to which it belongs [like in JS]

Returns.##########
Same as JS. Just (return x)
[python squares note: x**2, pow(x, 2)]
